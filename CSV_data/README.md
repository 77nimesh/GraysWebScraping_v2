# Instructions for Sold and Referred Cars CSV Data

This guide explains how to understand and use the `sold_cars.csv` and `referred_cars.csv` data generated by the Grays Web Scraper project.

---

## Location of Files

Both files are saved automatically in the `CSV_data/` folder:

```bash
CSV_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ sold_cars.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ referred_cars.csv
```

---

## Meaning of Files

- **sold_cars.csv**: Contains detailed information about cars that were successfully **sold** at auction.
- **referred_cars.csv**: Contains detailed information about cars that were **referred** (unsold or reserve price not met).

## Handling of Unknown and Missing Values

- Any **unknown** or **missing** values during scraping are saved as a **question mark (`?`)**.
- Numeric fields that cannot be determined (e.g., `price`, `current_bid`, `number_of_bids`) will be saved as `0` if necessary or `?` where appropriate.
- This ensures a clean and consistent dataset for further analysis.

**Examples:**
- If VIN is not available, it will be stored as `?`.
- If Registration Expiry Date is missing, it will be stored as `?`.
- If number of bids could not be found, it will default to `0`.

## How to Use This Data

- **Sold Cars Analysis:**
  - Market price trends
  - Most popular makes/models
  - State-wise pricing
  
- **Referred Cars Analysis:**
  - Understand reserve pricing behavior
  - Measure buyer interest by bid counts
  - Potential opportunity for private purchase

- **General:**
  - Track auction turnover
  - Estimate car condition vs final price

## Example Usage in Python

```python
import pandas as pd

sold_df = pd.read_csv('CSV_data/sold_cars.csv')
referred_df = pd.read_csv('CSV_data/referred_cars.csv')

# Filter sold cars above $20,000
expensive_cars = sold_df[sold_df['price'] > 20000]

# Find referred cars with more than 10 bids
hot_referred = referred_df[referred_df['number_of_bids'] > 10]

print(expensive_cars[['make', 'model', 'price']])
print(hot_referred[['make', 'model', 'current_bid']])
```

---

## Best Practices

- Always use `current_bid` along with `number_of_bids` to evaluate car desirability.
- Use `Location` (state) if filtering auctions by pickup area.
- Combine multiple auction results over weeks/months for larger trend analysis.
